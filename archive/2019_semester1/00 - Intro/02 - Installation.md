# Python Installation
## Downloading Python on your machine
There are few ways to get python on your machine:
- Most Linux and MacOS ship with Python 2 already installed, you probably want to install a new version.
- The basic official way: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- The scientific computing way: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section


I highly recommend getting ***Python 3.6 or above***

While you wait for the installation, please fill in the [Pre-Course Survey](03&#32;-&#32;Pre-Course&#32;Survey.md) =)
