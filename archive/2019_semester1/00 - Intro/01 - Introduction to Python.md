# What is Python
Definition from [python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)
> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. [...]

In short:
- It's a **swiss army knife** language (battery included & great ecosystem)
- It's **simple** (dynamic, high level)
- It's **readable** (almost pseudocode, clean syntax)
- It's **free** & **open-source**
- It's **tinker-friendly** (raspberry pi, )

# Python Uses and Misuses:
Here's a list of what python is good for and what is not (stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/30hncn/what_python_used_for/))

## Python Uses:
- Scripting
- Scientific and mathematical computing
- Data Analysis: stock markets, etc
- Big data (machine learning, data mining, etc...)
- Education: the [most commonly](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) taught language in universities
- Computer graphics: embedded into many popular 3rd party programs such as FreeCAD, 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya, Gimp, Inkscape, etc.
- System automation and administration
- Security and penetration testing
- Web development
- Mapping and geography: Python is commonly used by many GIS software

## Not Python Uses:
- Writing operating systems: Python isn't low-level enough
- Mobile: major players in mobile do not adopt Python, though there are people working very hard to bring Python to mobile (see [Kivy](https://kivy.org))
- Highly Concurrent Code: current implementations of Python are unfortunately not so fantastic with concurrency, though there are people working to change that too.
- High Execution Speed: pure Python is slower than other languages like C and Java, (though sometimes [it does not matter much](https://medium.com/@trungluongquang/why-python-is-popular-despite-being-super-slow-83a8320412a9) or there are ways around it).
