# Python Installation

## Downloading Python on your machine

There are few ways to get python on your machine:

- Most Linux and MacOS ship with Python 2 already installed, you **probably want to install a new version**.
- The basic official way: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - Having trouble? follow this guide: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
- The scientific computing way: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
  - Anaconda is a distribution that bundles python with a lot of scientific computing libraries and tools, including Jupyter. Once installed look for it in your Start menu.

I highly recommend getting **_Python 3.8 or above_**

## Tinkering with Python on the Web

If you just want to play around with it, there are also plenty of ways to play around with Python without installing it:

- Python Online Editors:
  - [python.org shell](https://www.python.org/shell/)
  - [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3)
  - [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python3)
  - [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler)
  - .. many others (just google "python online editor")
- Jupyter Notebooks online ([more details](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/)):
  - [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/try.jupyter.org?urlpath=lab)
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
  - [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
